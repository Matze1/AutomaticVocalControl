\chapter*{Abstract}

The objective of this study was to develop a plug-in for digital audio workstations which reduces the long term dynamics of vocal signals to release mixing engineers of this task. The project started with the creation of a prototype which had the main functionality implemented. Subsequently, it was improved by adding additional features,i.e. being able to write a gain automation into the digital audio workstation or enable automatic parameters settings. In addition to these improvements a side chain feature was added extending the use of the plug-in by adjusting the vocal signal output level to the side chain input level (in anticipated use: the instrumental backtrack).\\
The prototype's outcome was compared to the commercially available plug-in “Vocal Rider”\footnote{waves.com/plugins/vocal-rider} which is a plug-in with similar functions. Some improvements were based on this comparison as well as it influenced the subsequently parameter setting.\\
Finally, the advantages of the side chain feature were evaluated by hearing tests with independent participants.\\
