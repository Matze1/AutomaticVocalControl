\chapter*{Abstract}

The goal of this study was to develop a plug-in for digital audio workstations which reduces the long term dynamics of vocal signals to release mixing engineers of this task. It started with the creation of a prototype which had the main functionality implemented. Subsequently the prototype's outcome was compared to the plug-in “Vocal Rider”\footnote{waves.com/plugins/vocal-rider} which is a plug-in with similar purpose.\\
After the comparison the prototype was improved through additional features like writing a gain automation into the digital audio workstation or self detecting parameters. During these improvements the side chain feature was added which extends the use of the plug-in by adjusting the vocal signal output level to the side chain input level (in predicted use: the instrumental backtrack). The advantages of this feature were finally evaluated by a hearing test with independent participants.
