\section{Outcome}

The realisation of the objective could be performed with a satisfactory result. During the process of development the JUCE Framework emphasises as a good choice by supporting with basic but solid functionality for an audio plug-in which would be very time consuming to build up from scratch.\\
With the first prototype it was already possible to obtain favourable results (reasonable parameter settings implied). Nevertheless it still had some problems and unfinished design decisions. The comparison to the “Vocal Rider” approved the functionality of the prototype but also pointed out the differences between the two approaches of the plug-ins. Despite the differences the comparison resulted in ideas for further improvements of the study plug-in.\\
In retrospective quite a lot improvements enhanced the prototype. The additions with most influence on the plug-ins performance where the extra idle time for ignoring small breathing or rhythmic gaps between vocal signals, the arability to draw gain automations into the DAW, the side chain feature and the automatic detection of parameters.\\
The side chain feature validated its use in the according hearing test where its advantages for the plug-in where observable as well as the outcome of a plug-in with this feature enabled getting quite close to the optimal reference which performed the gain adaption with oracle knowledge.\\

\section{Future Improvements}

The study plug-in meets the requirement of the objective but it can still improve.\\
E.g. the parameter detection is an optional feature which can be useful to set the plug-in correctly especially at the first interactions by a user but like described in the corresponding sections 5.2 and 5.3, it is only able to calculate ‘online’ during playback of the song. An offline calculation is not implemented for now which would be significantly faster. As one purpose of the plug-in is to save time, it would be great to implement this addition to the feature in further development. When the offline calculation is possible it would be able to measure the perceived signal level by using the loudness algorithm (ITU-R BS.1770-4) which may improve the plug-in’s outcome.\\
An other example of a reasonable future improvement would be to extend its scope of application. Currently it is designed to work with vocal signals but other recordings can have similar problems e.g. recordings of the bass guitar. Therefore it would be useful to have the opportunity to chose between different presets for the main constants of the plug-in’s calculation, fitting the different signals.\\
Additional to possible algorithmic improvements it could be going through further testing for increased stability and correctness of the results.\\
