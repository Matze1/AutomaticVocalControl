\chapter{Evaluation of the Side Chain Feature}
\label{chapter:evaluation}

The plug-in got some improvements over the time. One significant improvement was the side chain feature which will compensate for a whole further work step of the mixing engineer when it is functioning as intended. To proof the advantages of this feature a listening test was done after the implementation. In the best case this could proof that there is no critical difference to a track volume automation additional to the main plug-in, drawn by a mixing engineer who knows about the level changes in the backtrack. At least it should verify the feature by demonstrate its advantages to the prototype in different circumstances.\\

\section{Test conditions}

To receive results fitting the question about side chain advantages at the performed test, participants had to compare the backtrack/vocal level relation for audio files with the plug-in effecting the vocal gain with and without the side chain feature enabled. Additionally at every comparison there was a reference track where gain automations were drawn with oracle knowledge about the level change of the according backtrack. This track also had the plug-in inserted but without the side chain feature supporting. To establish the equivalence of the test scores an forth audio track with intensional divergent backtrack/vocal relation was added to perform as an anchor.\\
In the first 10 test sections the participants had to listen the reference track as aspired result and subsequently compare the backtrack/vocal level relation with four test items. The test items were mixes of the same song snippet but with varying gain adaption on the vocal tracks: the anchor with intensional divergent gain, a mix with the plug-in while the side chain feature was enabled, a mix altered by the plug-in without a side chain input and an unmodified copy of the reference. While comparing these test items with the as reference declared first audio file the participants did not know about the differences in the creation of the other four. The task was to rank the test items in their similarity of backtrack/vocal level relation to the reference on a percentage scale.\\
As the main plug-in is designed to push comprehensibility and clarity of the vocals in the mix, it remained the question if an additional gain from the side chain feature could influence this in a bad way. Consequently four additional test sections appended the procedure where comprehensibility and clarity where rated by the participants.\\
For the realisation of a valid test a important thing to do was picking usable song parts for the comparison. Therefore three different multitrack projects (see 2.3) were used as source for the audio snippets. As the benefit of the side chain feature is the adaption on backtrack level changes, at the beginning of all three songs the study plug-ins were initialised with settings to fit the local backtrack level. During this process loudnessGoal and side chain input-gain were set by the detection algorithm of the study plug-in. In the middle of the musical piece the backtrack level was changed due to a level automation. This was done in addition to the regular level changes of the backtrack to intensify the differences of the varying plug-in setting to be tested. The reference vocals with oracle knowledge got the same automations as the backtrack and where supplementary levelled to fit the backtrack at all the different song parts. The study plug-in with the side chain feature enabled had to adapt to the backtrack level changes itself while the same plug-in operated on the third vocal variation without the additional side chain informations. The level of the anchor was set manually in order to not resemble the reference track.\\
To have a wide range of circumstances tested for the plug-ins three to four different snippets were taken from each of the songs. These snippets are containing song parts before and after the backtrack level automation just like clips from the exact part where the level change is happening. Additionally the test was extended by snippets of song parts with vocals during instrumental breaks as these circumstances were especially difficult to handle at side chain feature development.\\
While the backtrack/vocal level relations were tested with all different kinds of snippets, the comprehensibility and clarity comparison was made with clips where the plug-in with the disabled side chain feature was adjusted in its output gain according to the current backtrack level to have a fair comparison. A single test was deviating from this scheme and therefore evaluated independently.\\
The test was realised in a HTML5 JavaScript browser application build with beaqlejs-0.2\footnote{S. Kraft, U. ZÃ¶lzer: "BeaqleJS: HTML5 and JavaScript based Framework for the Subjective Evaluation of Audio Quality", Linux Audio Conference, 2014, Karlsruhe, Germany} using the MUSHRA test class. This framework already contained the necessary evaluation sliders and the functionality for the playback of the test items. To avoid confusion about comparison criteria the randomisation of test sections is disabled. Therefore the 10 backtrack/vocal level relation tests are followed by four comprehensibility and clarity tests. In order to receive independent results on each test the test items for evaluation are at randomised positions differing for each of the tests. During the tests the participants were listening to the audio clips on professional studio equipment in a quiet room for unadulterated results.\\
The outcome of finally 18 test candidates was transferred into a table and subsequently evaluated.\\

\section{Vocal Level}

Due to the initialisation of the different set plug-ins for the test vocal tracks, the audio clips from the beginning of the songs have similar backtrack/vocal relations. Especially the oracle track and the plug-in without side chain have the same outcome at start. Despite the additional influence of the side chain algorithm the plug-in with the side chain feature enabled was ranked very close to the other two. The backtrack/vocal relation was judged not even differing a whole percent on average from the plug-in without side chain. As follows the side chain feature seems to have no bad influence on the level outcome in comparison to a well gained (using the output gain to compensate the level gap between backtrack and vocals) plug-in without side chain.\\
At a backtrack level change the side chain feature has to adapt the level of the outcome and the plug-in without side chain will stay on the same output gain. As expected the vocal level results at backtrack level changes from the plug-in with side chain enabled were rated closer to the optimal reference. In average the side chain feature got the according test snippets rated 29\% closer to 100\% similarity with the reference as the plug-in without this feature. This average rating is very close to the rating of the reference copy. As consequence it is to conclude that the side chain feature leads to gain automations with similar results like a mixing engineer would draw. Additionally a advantage over the plug-in without a side chain input can be noticeably observed.\\
The audio clips with the vocal level already adapted by the side chain feature got ratings with even more advantage over the the plug-in without side chain. In average the side chain enabled plug-in was 35\% closer to the optimal result for each of those test files.\\
At instrumental breaks the ratings for the side chain adaption where about 5\% behind the total average but still better than the plug-in without side chain.\\
In total the similarity to the reference in terms of vocal/backtrack relation was rated 62\% for the plug-in without side chain. The side chain enabled plug-in got with an average value of 84\% very close to the copy of the optimal reference which was rated with 87\% similarity to itself on average.\\
