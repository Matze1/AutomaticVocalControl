\chapter{Evaluation of the Side Chain Feature}
\label{chapter:evaluation}

The plug-in got some improvements over the time. One significant improvement was the side chain feature which will compensate for a whole further work step of the mixing engineer when it is functioning as intended. To proof the advantages of this feature a listening test was done after the implementation. In the best case this could proof that there is no critical difference to a track volume automation additional to the main plug-in, drawn by a mixing engineer who knows about the level changes in the backtrack. At least it should verify the feature by demonstrate its advantages to the prototype in different circumstances.\\
