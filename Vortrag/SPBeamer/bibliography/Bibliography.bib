	title = {{ALGONQUIN}: Iterating Laplace's Method to Remove Multiple Types of Acoustic Distortion for Robust Speech Recognition},
	url = {http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=76516},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}One approach to robust speech recognition is to use a simple speech model to remove the distortion, before applying the speech recognizer. Previous attempts at this approach have relied on unimodal or point estimates of the noise for each utterance. In challenging acoustic environments, e.g., an airport, the spectrum of the noise changes rapidly during an utterance, making a point estimate a poor representation. We show how an iterative form of Laplace’s method can be used to estimate the clean speech, using a time-varying probability model of the log-spectra of the clean speech, noise and channel distortion. We use this method, called {ALGONQUIN}, to denoise speech features and then feed these features into a large vocabulary speech recognizer whose {WER} on the clean Wall Street Journal data is 4.9\%. When 10 {dB} of noise consisting of an airplane engine shutting down is added to the data, the recognizer obtains a {WER} of 28.8\%. {ALGONQUIN} reduces the {WER} to 12.6\%, well below the {WER} of 25.0\% obtained by our spectral subtraction algorithm, and close to the {WER} of 9.7\% obtained by the slow procedure of retraining the recognizer on training data corrupted by the exact same noise. In fact, if {ALGONQUIN} is used to denoise the noisy training data before the recognizer is retrained, the {WER} is improved to 8.5\%. For 10 {dB} of additive uniform white noise, our spectral subtraction algorithm reduces the {WER} from 55.1\% to 33.8\%. {ALGONQUIN} reduces the {WER} to 14.2\%. The recognizer trained on noisy data obtains a {WER} of 14\%, whereas the recognizer trained on noisy data denoised by {ALGONQUIN} obtains a {WER} of 9.9\%.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The noise is assumed additive to the signal, and the spectral components of each process are assumed statistically independent complex Gaussian random variables. The key result developed here is an explicit expression for the cross-covariance between the log-periodograms of the clean and noisy signals. In the absence of noise, this expression is used to show that the covariance matrix of cepstral components representing N signal samples, is a fixed signal independent matrix, which approaches a diagonal matrix at a rate of 1/N. In addition, the cross-covariance expression is used to develop an explicit linear minimum mean square error estimator for the clean cepstral components given noisy cepstral components. Recognition results on the English digits using the fixed covariance and linear estimator are presented},

The novel parametric estimator has many known magnitude estimators as a special solution and, additionally, affords estimators that combine the beneficial properties of different known solutions.

	abstract = {In this paper, statistical speech enhancement using hidden Markov model ({HMM}) is studied and new techniques for applying non-Gaussian distributions are proposed. The superiority of using non-Gaussian distributions in online adaptive noise suppression algorithms has been proven; however, in this study, this approach is formulated in an {HMM}-based mean-square error estimator ({MMSE}) estimator in which a priori models are trained in an off-line manner. In addition, an analytical study of using different distributions other than autoregressive ({AR}) Gaussian distribution, such as Laplace, is presented in order to construct an accurate {HMM} as a priori model for discrete Fourier transform and discrete cosine transform feature vectors of speech signal. In the proposed framework, an {HMM}-based {MMSE} estimator bassed on Gaussian assumption using diagonal covariance matrix is provided rather than {AR} hypothesis which is employed in the conventional {AR}-{HMM}-based speech enhancement algorithm. Experimental evaluations of the proposed methods are done in the presence of four different noise types at various signal-to-noise ratio levels which demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in most conditions in comparison with {AR}-{HMM}.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the class of speech enhancement systems which capitalize on the major importance of the short-time spectral amplitude ({STSA}) of the speech signal in its perception. A system which utilizes a minimum mean-square error ({MMSE}) {STSA} estimator is proposed and then compared with other widely used systems which are based on Wiener filtering and the "spectral subtraction" algorithm. In this paper we derive the {MMSE} {STSA} estimator, based on modeling speech and noise spectral components as statistically independent Gaussian random variables. We analyze the performance of the proposed {STSA} estimator and compare it with a {STSA} estimator derived from the Wiener estimator. We also examine the {MMSE} {STSA} estimator under uncertainty of signal presence in the noisy observations. In constructing the enhanced signal, the {MMSE} {STSA} estimator is combined with the complex exponential of the noisy phase. It is shown here that the latter is the {MMSE} estimator of the complex exponential of the original phase, which does not affect the {STSA} estimation. The proposed approach results in a significant reduction of the noise, and provides enhanced speech with colorless residual noise. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is approximately that of other systems in the discussed class.},

	abstract = {We describe a method to estimate the power spectral density of nonstationary noise when a noisy speech signal is given. The method can be combined with any speech enhancement algorithm which requires a noise power spectral density estimate. In contrast to other methods, our approach does not use a voice activity detector. Instead it tracks spectral minima in each frequency band without any distinction between speech activity and speech pause. By minimizing a conditional mean square estimation error criterion in each time step we derive the optimal smoothing parameter for recursive smoothing of the power spectral density of the noisy speech signal. Based on the optimally smoothed power spectral density estimate and the analysis of the statistics of spectral minima an unbiased noise estimator is developed. The estimator is well suited for real time implementations. Furthermore, to improve the performance in nonstationary noise we introduce a method to speed up the tracking of the spectral minima. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method in the context of speech enhancement and low bit rate speech coding with various noise types},

We will show that the {MMSE} based spectral noise power estimate is only updated when the a posteriori signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) is lower than one. This threshold on the a posteriori {SNR} can be interpreted as a voice activity detector ({VAD}). We propose in this work to replace the hard decision of the {VAD} by a soft speech presence probability ({SPP}). We show that by doing so, the proposed estimator does not require a bias correction and safety-net as is required by the {MMSE} estimator presented in [1]. At the same time, the proposed estimator maintains the quick noise tracking capability which is characteristic for the {MMSE} noise tracker, results in less noise power overestimation and is computationally less expensive.},

The algorithm combines a normalization stage, to remove channel dependency and to attenuate strong noise components, with a harmonic summing filter applied in the log-frequency power spectral domain, the impulse response of which is chosen to sum the energy of the fundamental frequency harmonics while attenuating smoothly-varying noise components. Temporal continuity constraints are applied to the selected pitch candidates and a voiced speech probability is computed from the likelihood ratio of two classifiers, one for voiced speech and one for unvoiced speech/silence. We compare the performance of our algorithm with that of other widely used algorithms and demonstrate that it performs well in both high and low levels of additive noise.},

In the cepstral domain the noisy speech signal is decomposed into coefficients related mainly to the speech envelope, the excitation, and noise. As in the cepstral domain coefficients that represent speech can be robustly determined, we can apply little smoothing to speech coefficients and strong smoothing to noise coefficients. Thus, speech components are preserved and musical noise is suppressed. In speech enhancement experiments we obtain consistent improvements over the well known decision-directed approach.},

	abstract = {Complex-valued random signals are embedded in the very fabric of science and engineering, yet the usual assumptions made about their statistical behavior are often a poor representation of the underlying physics. This book deals with improper and noncircular complex signals, which do not conform to classical assumptions, and it demonstrates how correct treatment of these signals can have significant payoffs. The book begins with detailed coverage of the fundamental theory and presents a variety of tools and algorithms for dealing with improper and noncircular signals. It provides a comprehensive account of the main applications, covering detection, estimation, and signal analysis of stationary, nonstationary, and cyclostationary processes. Providing a systematic development from the origin of complex signals to their probabilistic description makes the theory accessible to newcomers. This book is ideal for graduate students and researchers working with complex data in a range of research areas from communications to oceanography.},
